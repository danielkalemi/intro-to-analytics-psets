{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or 'Bacon's Law' is a game based on the 'six degrees of separation' concept, which posits that any two people on Earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. Movie buffs challenge each other to find the shortest path between an arbitrary actor and prolific actor Kevin Bacon. It rests on the assumption that anyone involved in the Hollywood film industry can be linked through their film roles to Bacon within six steps.\n","\n","In this assignment you will put this assertion to the test by building a large graph of movies and stars and computing the degrees of separation between Kevin Bacon and other performers"],"metadata":{"id":"ReHwFlSw7jg5"},"id":"ReHwFlSw7jg5"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"c6ffefd5","metadata":{"id":"c6ffefd5"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Breadth-first search / Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon or 'Bacon's Law'\n","#Build a large graph of movies & stars and compute the degrees of separation between Kevin and other performers\n","\n","#Build a Vertex class corresponding to each vertex of our graph\n","class Vertex: \n","    #The constructor should take a single string (performer) and initialize three instance variables\n","    def __init__(self, performer):\n","        self.name = performer #the vertex name (performer's name) \n","        self.adjacent = []    #empty list (adjacent), containing vertices of co-star performers\n","        self.edge = []        #empty list (edge), contains the movie the performer has co-starred with the ones in the adjacent list. \n","    \n","    #function that returns the name of the vertex, the first movie and the corresponding co-star\n","    def __str__(self):\n","        n = len(self.edge)\n","        display = str(self.name)\n","        for i in range (n): \n","            display = display + '|'+ (self.edge[i]) + '/' + (self.adjacent[i])\n","        return display"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e2fbb8f8","metadata":{"id":"e2fbb8f8"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Using your vertex class, build a graph from the data in movies.txt\n","\n","movie_data = open('movies.txt','r',encoding = \"ISO-8859-1\") #open movies.txt file\n","file = movie_data.read()\n","all_lines = file.splitlines() #split the file in lines separated by slash \n","graph = {} #empty dictionary\n","\n","for line in all_lines:     #go through the file for each line\n","    data = line.split(\"/\") #split the data that is in-between the slashes\n","    movie_title = data[0]  #movie title is positioned at the begining of each line\n","    stars = data[1:]  #anything after the movie title are the names of the costarred actors\n","    #each time you extract a performer's name, determine if it is already a vertex in the graph. \n","    #If the performer is in the graph, update the adjacent and edge lists with all of the other performers in the movie.\n","    \n","    for actor in stars:      \n","        stars_copy = stars.copy() #makes a copy of all_actors and puts it in something else\n","        stars_copy.remove(actor) #don't include the performer that is represented by the current vertex\n","        \n","        #If it is not in the graph, create a new vertex for this performer, \n","        #and populate the adjacent and edge with all of the other performers in the movie \n","        #except for the performer that is represented by this vertex. \n","        if actor not in graph: \n","            graph[actor] = Vertex(actor)\n","        graph[actor].adjacent.extend(stars_copy)\n","        graph[actor].edge.extend([movie_title]*len(stars_copy)) \n","        \n","        for costar in stars_copy:\n","            if costar not in graph: \n","                graph[costar] = Vertex(costar)\n","            graph[costar].edge.append(movie_title)\n","            graph[costar].adjacent.append(actor)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"2b2fc90e","metadata":{"id":"2b2fc90e"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Breadth-first-search using the Vertex class.\n","\n","from collections import deque\n","\n","# Run bfs and find the path from the Vertex start to the Vertex goal.\n","# Return that path as a list of Vertex objects.
